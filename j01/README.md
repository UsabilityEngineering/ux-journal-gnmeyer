UX Journal 1

Grant Meyer 

  I occasionally use a nutrition app called *“BobbyApproved”*. This app will inform you about the ingredients of food items from a variety of different stores. What I want to focus on in this journal is the confusing menu system which leads to **user dissatisfaction** because it does not behave as expected. To set the scene, when I log onto the app I am easily able to navigate to the *“Works at All Stores”* menu and can clearly hit the *“View all”* button to navigate to a page which displays all stores that the app has data on.

*All Stores Page*

If I were to click on *Costco*, I enter into the *Costco Home Page* and am presented with a clear listing of different food groups which I can click on to enter into each subcategory. Notice on the top left corner there is a back arrow button.

**Familiarity** in UX enables the transfer of experience between similar products or services, allowing us to be productive without first learning how a system works.) Users who are **familiar** with technology expect that this button will take us back one menu, which in our case is back to the *“All Stores Page”*. This works as expected, however the poor design arises when we navigate into a food group menu. In the picture below, I have navigated into the *"Poultry, Chicken & Turkey"* menu. 
Notice there is a back arrow button in the top left corner as in the *Costco Home Page*. My **assumption** is that this Back button will take me back to the Costco page (The home page where I can view all the different sub categories). However, this button actually takes me back to the “all stores” page.

I cannot count the number of times I've been slightly **frustrated** when I click this button and jump back two pages, and then have to navigate back to the store and then to the specific food group I was in. As a UX designer, we need to try our hardest to *match our users **assumptions***. **User dissatisfaction** occurs when their ***assumptions** are not matched*. There is also a back arrow button near the *“Poultry, Chicken & Turkey”* title. This is the button that takes us back to the Costco page. However another design flaw occurs when we scroll down the page. The top left back button (which takes us back to the store page) moves down the page as we scroll, whereas the back button which takes us to the *"Costco Home Page"* does not move down as we scroll. Eventually, once we scroll far enough down, the back button that takes use to the *Costco Home Page* (The Button next to *Poultry, Chicken & Turkey*) Will disappear. This means that users will always see the incorrect back button and **intuitively** think that this button will take them back to the store page. This leads to **frustration** when the user clicks the button expecting to go to one place but are instead taken to another.
